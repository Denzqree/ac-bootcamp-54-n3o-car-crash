This project was made by Daniel Madeira during his late-2020 bootcamp @ < Academia de CÃ³digo _>.

In this project, we had to make an implementation of a car-crash simulator
using the Lanterna GFX libraries

The implementations made here are for the Position class, which defines a position
in the Field's class grid, for each car that was also implemented using a super-class
for abstracting a car's behaviour, and implemented for each car type (that is defined
in an enum class). Here, we also have a Car Factory that uses the Factory Design Pattern.

It was a nice project to work on, and there's also another version here on my GitHub
that is implemented using the SimpleGFX library made by <A/C_>'s Master Coders.
