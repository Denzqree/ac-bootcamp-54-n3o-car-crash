------------------ Project car-crash by n3o ----------------------------------------------------

This project was made by Daniel Madeira during his late-2020 bootcamp @ < Academia de CÃ³digo _>.

It was made on IntelliJ (also works with Community version), and uses Java 8's JDK from Oracle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this project, we had to make an implementation of a car-crash simulator
using the Lanterna GFX libraries.

Each car has a Position in a Field, and they move accordingly to their specifications until
they crash.

The implementations made here are for the Position class, which defines a position in the Field's
class grid, for each car that was also implemented using a super-class for abstracting a car's
behaviour, and implemented for each car type (that is defined in an enum class).

Here, we also have a Car Factory that uses the Factory Design Pattern.

It was a nice project to work on, and there's also another version here on my GitHub
that is implemented using the SimpleGFX library made by <A/C_>'s Master Coders.
